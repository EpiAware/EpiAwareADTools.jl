# `primal` is a tape-strip returning a non-differentiable primal value (a
# quadrature-window endpoint, a clamp location — just *where* to do something,
# carrying no gradient). Marking it `@non_differentiable` keeps reverse-mode AD
# — and Mooncake, which lifts ChainRules rules — from tracing through it.

# Reverse- and forward-mode rules for `_gamma_cdf(k, θ, x) = P(k, x/θ)`. The
# analytical partials live in `_gamma_cdf_value_and_partials` (in
# `src/gamma_ad.jl`) so the ForwardDiff Dual path and the direct Enzyme rule
# share the same formulas. Only the k-partial is non-trivial — that's the term
# SpecialFunctions' own ChainRule leaves as `@not_implemented`; see
# `_grad_p_a_series` for the series form (Moore 1982 AS 187, the same
# construction Stan and JAX use).

# Forward-mode rule, used by Mooncake's forward mode via the `@from_chainrules`
# lift in `EpiAwareADToolsMooncakeExt` (ForwardDiff dispatches on `Dual` types
# directly, so it never reaches here). Without this, Mooncake's forward lift
# calls `ChainRulesCore.frule`, which returns `nothing` for an undefined rule
# and trips `iterate(::Nothing)`.
